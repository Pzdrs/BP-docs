You have a two main options for deploying the ESGPS dashboard, depending on your needs. The recommended and most well documented option is [Docker](docker.md). With the help of Docker Compose, you can have the dashboard up and running in a matter of minutes. We offer docker images for a majority of platforms. You can also install and run the dashboard from [source](source.md) if Docker is not your thing.
