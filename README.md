# Bachelor project documentation

Documentation for my bachelor project, which consists of two separate repositories: [data source firmware](https://github.com/Pzdrs/BP-firmware) and the [application](https://github.com/Pzdrs/BP-app). This documentation is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the project, its components, and the deployment process. 

## Overview

The content is structured in a way that allows for easy navigation and understanding of the project's architecture. __MkDocs__ with the Material theme is used to generate the documentation. 

It is split into two main sections: the data source firmware and its physical construction and the application. Each section is further divided into subcategories, which provide detailed information on the respective components. 

The documentation is written in Markdown and is hosted on GitHub Pages. It is accessible at [https://pzdrs.github.io/BP-docs/](https://pzdrs.github.io/BP-docs/).
